## Summary

From childhood what I loved the most was solving math problems and logical puzzles, I feel the same excitement while working on programming tasks. That is why I decided to become a professional software engineer. Currently, I enjoy doing front-end development and I am really excited about new frameworks and technologies in the field. I am fascinated that this field grows quickly and there is always something new to learn and challenge myself.
